# Hi, I'm Andrew Antaya

This is my personal website where I post updates about my on-going GitHub projects, and where I write longer articles about data science, programming, and things I've picked up along the way. I'm currently a research specialist at the Univeristy of Arizona, where I work on studies related to rangeland management and grazing animals.

I'm most well-versed in Python and R, but I firmly believe you should use the programming language and tooling which best solves your problem. My journey to programming was not straightforward, but I came to love the process, and the mighty power programming can provide when wielded wisely.

I'm learning to embrace the philosphy of "learning in the open" where we build our knowledge and skills in public. When we learn in public, we can share our knowledge and learn from each other. I'm on my own learning journey, and I hope you'll join me.

## My Projects

[](https://github.com/amantaya/grazeR)
I'm leading development of an R package called `grazeR` which is designed to facilitate the analysis of data from grazing studies. There isn't (to my knowledge) a standardized set of tools in the rangeland science and grazing management field to process and analyze data. From my experience interacting with other scientists, the typical steps are this: collect data, develop our own R or Python scripts to analyze data, publish our study, and then move on. That code, which is so integral to the conclusions drawn from our study, is rarely made public, and even more rarely, is reproducible and reusable. Each script is a one-off creation, and countless researchers have unnecessarily recreated the work of other researchers. Writing good code is HARD, and we can speed up the scientific discovery process by giving scientists the tools to automate the tedious and mundane, and achieve faster results.
